      <h2>Web Frameworks </h2>
      <p>by Ian Yuki </p>

    <h3>What is a Web Framework? </h3>

    <p>A <strong>web framework </strong> is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs. These frameworks provide a standardized way to build and deploy web applications by automating common tasks such as routing, database interaction, and user authentication.</p>

 
    <h3>Key Features of Web Frameworks </h3>
 <ol>
      <li><strong> Pre-written Code: </strong> Frameworks provide a structure for web applications, including basic functions for managing data and displaying it on web pages. </li> 
      <li> <strong> Libraries and Tools:</strong>They often come with libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, promoting code reuse. </li>
      <li> <strong> Security Features: </strong> Frameworks offer security features to protect against threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). </li>
      <li> <strong>Efficiency and Speed: </strong> By providing a structured environment, frameworks can make the development process faster and more efficient. </li>
      <li> <strong> MVC Architecture: </strong> Many frameworks follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the data model, user interface, and user input. </li>
      <li> <strong>Community and Support:  </strong> Most web development frameworks have strong communities and support, providing documentation, forums, and third-party tools.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>

<h4> Front-End Frameworks</h4>
<p>Front-end frameworks are used to create the user interface of the website that is seen and used by the users. They develop the client side of the application. </p>

<ul> 

<li> <strong>Angular: </strong> An open-source TypeScript-based framework created by Google. It provides features like two-way data binding, form handling, routing, and dependency injection.</li>
<li> <strong>Vue.js: </strong> An open-source JavaScript-based framework that supports Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It is easy to learn and has large community support.</li>
<li> <strong>Bootstrap </strong> An open-source CSS-based framework developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps in creating responsive and platform-independent websites.</li>
</ul> 

<h4> Back-End Frameworks</h4>
<p>Back-end frameworks are used on the server side of the application. They provide backend functionalities responsible for handling requests, databases, and communicating with APIs.</p>
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> An open-source Ruby-based framework that follows the MVC architecture. It is known for its productivity and ease of use.</li>
  <li><strong>Django: </strong>An open-source Python-based framework that provides a speedy development of web applications. It is based on the Model-Template-View (MTV) architecture. </li>
  <li><strong>Spring Boot:</strong>An open-source Java-based framework that enables developers to develop production-ready and standalone applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Benefits of Using Web Frameworks</h3>
<ul> 
<li><strong>Reduced Development Time: </strong> Frameworks provide pre-written code and tools that speed up the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong>Built-in security features help protect against common threats. </li>
<li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Frameworks promote code reuse, making the development process more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Strong community support provides access to documentation, forums, and third-party tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web frameworks are essential tools for modern web development, offering a structured and efficient way to build robust and scalable web applications. Whether you are working on the front-end or back-end, there is a framework that can meet your needs and help you develop high-quality web applications. </p>
